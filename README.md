**Boilerplate/PoC of a version of the Rete Algorithm implementated in Elixir**

Rete is a complex stateful algorithm, this is an attempt of reproducing it with some slight modifications, using a functional immutable language such as Elixir/Erlang. [Read more about Rete](http://www.csl.sri.com/users/mwfong/Technical/RETE%20Match%20Algorithm%20-%20Forgy%20OCR.pdf)


## Concepts

- Retex compiles the rules using a directed acyclic graph data structure
- The activation of nodes is done using a [State Monad and Forward Chaining](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303626297_Forward_Chaining_with_State_Monad).
- A list of bindinds is stored at each active node in order to generate complete matches from partial ones


## Warnings

- Use at your own risk
- This is just a template for complexer implementations of the described algorithms
